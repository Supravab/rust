# rust
this is the important notes and documentation file for the entire journey of learning rust.
Only consist of main topics and important points, nothing more...

cargo check : this will check if the code is compilable without making it into executable
use case : periodically checking if the code is right without making it into an executable.

cargo init : initiallize the rust file using cargo, to include cargo into the project.

creating a new project is done by cargo new.

cargo stores the executable file in the target/debug

cargo build --release : this will create executable release file for cargo project, and put it in target/release

macro : it is basically a function that can take in variable number of arguements, it can check syntax before running.
example : println!("{}", variables); here the ! is the macro.
